    """ A summary of the linear regression model for estimating scope 1 emmissions using stationary combustion.

The accuracy of predicting scope 1 emmisions based on stationary combustion is too low to be considered to be used. This low accuracy may be potentially linked to the volume of missing and 0 value data present in the columns that produce the total for scope 1 emmissions. In order generate a more accurate model more data is needed that does not consist of 0 values. The results of accuracy for the model are explained below.

Mean absolute Error: 101053.87784241795

In the context of machine learning, absolute error refers to the magnitude of difference between the prediction of an observation and the true value of that observation. MAE takes the average of absolute errors for a group of predictions and observations as a measurement of the magnitude of errors for the entire group. MAE can also be referred as L1 loss function. As can be ssen the mean absolute error for this model is considerably high


Mean Absolute percentage Error: 40.67376511434855

Mean absolute percentage error measures the average magnitude of error produced by a model, or how far off predictions are on average. A MAPE value of 40% means that the average absolute percentage difference between the predictions and the actuals is 40%. In other words, the modelâ€™s predictions are, on average, off by 40% from the real values. Suggesting that more data is required to make the model to be accurately used.This would require further attention / development in future models.
