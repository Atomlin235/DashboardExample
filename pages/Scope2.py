    """ A summary of the linear regression model for estimating scope 2 emmissions using Purchased Electricity.
The accuracy of predicting scope 2 emmisions based on Purchased Electricity is low , however, it is the most accurate model when compared to models for scope 1 and 3 emmisions. The main concern for this model is that values for purchased steam, heat and cooling are mostly missing/ 0 values. This missing data could potentially mean the model accuracy is misrepreseneted when applied to real world data.


Mean absolute Error: 7371.5774233583315

In the context of machine learning, absolute error refers to the magnitude of difference between the prediction of an observation and the true value of that observation. MAE takes the average of absolute errors for a group of predictions and observations as a measurement of the magnitude of errors for the entire group. MAE can also be referred as L1 loss function. As can be seen the mean absolute error for this model is somewhat high.


Mean Absolute percentage Error:3.6286663451654497e+18

Mean absolute percentage error measures the average magnitude of error produced by a model, or how far off predictions are on average. A MAPE value of 3.6286663451654497e+18 means that the average absolute percentage difference between the predictions and the actuals is 3.6286663451654497e+18. In other words, this model is somewhat accuarate at predicting scope 2 values based on the data provided, however, this could be linked to the values for purchased steam, heat and cooling being mostly missing/ 0 values. More complete data would need to be provided in order to determine the true accuracy of the model. """
