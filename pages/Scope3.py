The accuracy of predicting scope 3 emmisions based on Purchased Goods & Services is very low. 

Mean absolute Error: 1290756.1170379505

In the context of machine learning, absolute error refers to the magnitude of difference between the prediction of an observation and the true value of that observation. MAE takes the average of absolute errors for a group of predictions and observations as a measurement of the magnitude of errors for the entire group. MAE can also be referred as L1 loss function. As can be seen the mean absolute error for this model is extremely high. This model would not be applicable to be used as real world data would not produce accurate results.


Mean Absolute percentage Error:1.2450108947679812

Mean absolute percentage error measures the average magnitude of error produced by a model, or how far off predictions are on average. A MAPE value of 1.2450108947679812 means that the average absolute percentage difference between the predictions and the actuals is 1.2450108947679812. Although this percentage is low , the scores for MSE & and MAE are highly inaccurate. Suggesting predictions produced by this model are not reliable."""
