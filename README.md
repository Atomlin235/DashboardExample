# Sustainable-Planet-Dash
 

## Running locally

Run the following commands (untested):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
streamlit run About.py

or

python -m streamlit run Sustainable-Planet-Dash.py


```

### Troubleshooting

1) This is a multi-page app and requires streamlit v1.10 or greater to run. If you only see an about page you should run `pip install --upgrade streamlit` to resolve the issue.
